# Playground

AI Power's Playground is a dedicated sandbox feature that allows users to test and fine-tune their AI-generated content.

This powerful feature enables users to write their own prompts or use pre-built prompts in various categories and view the AI's output instantly. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to effectively utilize the Playground feature.

## Navigating to the Playground

To access the Playground, navigate to the **Content Writer** menu in your AI Power plugin and select the **Playground** tab.

## Selecting an AI Engine and Model

Before diving into categories and prompts, you can choose the AI engine and model that will process your content.

Above the **Category** section, you'll find two dropdown menus: **Provider** and **Model**.

For example, if you choose **WordPress**, you may find a prompt like *Write a case study on a successful WordPress website, detailing its design, growth strategies, and the impact of its content on its target audience.*

Similarly, for **Blogging**, a prompt might be *Write a blog post on how to effectively monetize a blog, discussing various methods such as affiliate marketing, sponsored content, and display advertising, as well as tips for maximizing revenue.*

Select a pre-built prompt or customize it according to your requirements.

You can also write your own prompt in the textbox provided.

## Generating, Viewing and Saving Output

With your prompt ready, click the 'Generate' button.

The AI will process your prompt and display the output on the right side of the Playground interface.
