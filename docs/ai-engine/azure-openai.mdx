# Azure

## Bring Your Own Key Model

Our plugin uses a *Bring Your Own Key* model, acting as a bridge between your WordPress site and Azure OpenAI services.

You need an Azure account and API credits from Azure to use our plugin. This approach lets you control your API keys and ensures access to the latest Azure OpenAI technology.

:::info
Buying our plugin does not include Azure credits. You need to purchase credits separately from Azure. Check their [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) for details.
