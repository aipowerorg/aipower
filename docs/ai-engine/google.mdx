## Bring Your Own Key Model

Our plugin uses a *Bring Your Own Key* model, acting as a bridge between your WordPress site and Google AI services.

You need a Google account and API credits from Google to use our plugin. This approach lets you control your API keys and ensures access to the latest Google AI technology.

:::info
Buying our plugin does not include Google credits. You need to purchase credits separately from Google. Check their [pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for details.

- Default setting is "Block None". You can choose to block content at different levels: Block None, Block Few, Block Some, or Block Most.
- The API response depends on the chosen safety level if offensive language is used.

## Limitations

Before setting Google as your provider, note its limitations:

- **Unsupported Modules**: Fine-tuning and Audio Converter.

When you enable Google:

1. **Speech to Text**: Disabled because Google's speech-to-text feature is not available on Google AI Studio yet.
2. **Moderation**: Google's content filtering replaces the plugin's moderation feature.
3. **Image Generator**: Google's image generator module is not publicly available yet.

Gemini Pro is still in early stages and not as stable as OpenAI's GPT models. Expect incomplete responses, nonsensical replies, and a higher rate of errors with this model.
