# API Key

## Bring Your Own Key Model

Our plugin uses a *Bring Your Own Key* model, acting as a bridge between your WordPress site and OpenAI.

To use our plugin, you need an OpenAI account and API credits. This approach lets you control your API keys and ensures access to the latest OpenAI technology.

:::info
Buying our plugin does not include any OpenAI credits. You need to purchase credits separately from OpenAI. Check their [pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for details.
