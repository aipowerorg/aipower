# Temperature

## What is Temperature?

Temperature controls the randomness in GPT's output. It helps you achieve different results.

- **Low Temperature**: GPT chooses words with higher probability. Useful for completing sentences with a single correct answer.
- **High Temperature**: Generates more varied responses. Useful for generating ideas or telling stories.

Remember, temperature is not the same as creativity. It only controls randomness. OpenAI recommends changing either temperature or top_p, but not both.

Understanding temperature can help you get the results you want. Spend time adjusting it to find the best setting for your needs.

## Adjusting the Temperature Setting

The default temperature is **0.7**. You can change it in the **AI Engine** tab.

Steps to change the temperature:

1. Go to the plugin menu on your WordPress dashboard.
2. Click on the **Settings** page and find the **AI Engine** tab.
3. Enter a new value in the **Temperature** field.

4. Click the **Save** button.

The temperature range is **0** to **1**. If you enter a value outside this range, you'll see a message: *"Please enter a valid temperature value between 0 and 1."*

Experiment with different values to find the best setting.

## Balancing Predictability and Creativity

Temperature values:

- **Low (below 0.5)**: More predictable and straightforward responses. Good for tasks needing a single correct answer.
- **Medium (0.5 to 0.9)**: Varied and creative but still realistic responses. Good for idea generation.
- **High (above 0.9)**: More unpredictable and open-ended responses. Good for creative tasks.

Experiment with new recipes, flavors, and textures to transform your relationship with food and embrace a lifestyle that is as nourishing as it is delicious."*

### Comparison

- **Low Temperature (0.2)**: Straightforward and predictable.
