# Top_P

## What is Top_P?

Top_P, also known as nucleus sampling, controls the diversity of the generated text by only considering tokens with the highest probability mass.

- **Top_P = 0.1**: Only tokens within the top 10% probability are considered.
- **Top_P = 0.9**: Considers tokens within the top 90% probability.

OpenAI recommends using either temperature sampling or nucleus sampling, but not both.

## Adjusting the Top_P Setting

The default Top_P value is **0.01**. You can change it in the **AI Engine** tab.

Steps to change the Top_P:

1. Go to the plugin menu on your WordPress dashboard.
2. Click on the **Settings** page and find the **AI Engine** tab.
3. Enter a new value in the **Top_P** field.

4. Click the **Save** button.

## Balancing Diversity in GPT Text Generation

Top_P controls how many of the highest-probability words are included in the generated text.

- **Lower Top_P value**: More diverse text.
- **Higher Top_P value**: More repetitive or "safe" text.

Increasing Top_P makes the model produce more conservative text by considering only the most probable outcomes, leading to less diversity. A lower Top_P value makes the model take more risks, generating more diverse text but with a higher chance of nonsensical sentences.

### Summary

- **Higher Top_P**: Generates safer, more repetitive text.
- **Lower Top_P**: Generates more diverse, riskier text.

Adjust the Top_P parameter to control the level of "risk" the model takes when generating text.
