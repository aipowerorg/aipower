# AI Settings

You can define different AI providers, models, and parameters for each chatbot.

## Selecting Provider

You can select the AI provider for your chatbot from the **Provider** dropdown. 

The default provider is **OpenAI**, but you can also choose from **OpenRouter**, **Google**, and **Azure**.

The available models will automatically adjust based on your selected provider.

Additionally, there's a **Sync** button next to the model dropdown, which allows you to retrieve the latest models from the provider.

- **Max Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens to generate.
- **Temperature**: Adjust the randomness. Higher values mean more randomness.
- **Frequency Penalty**: Control the frequency. Lower values mean more frequency. 
- **Presence Penalty**: Control the presence. Lower values mean more presence.
- **Top P**: Control the diversity. Lower values mean more predictability. 

Remember, the adjustments made to these parameters will directly influence the performance and response behavior of your chatbot. 

It is recommended to test different configurations to find what works best for your use case.
