# Tools

## Streaming

This feature allows the chatbot to display responses in real-time, showing parts of the response as they arrive from the API, rather than waiting for the full response.

You can enable or disable streaming from the **Dashboard - Chatbot** under the **General Settings** tab.

<img src={EnableStreaming} width="400"/>

The **Streaming** switch is on by default.

With streaming enabled, the chatbot displays each part of the response as soon as it's received, speeding up interactions.

Image upload and audio features like text-to-speech and speech-to-text don't work with streaming, as they require the full response to function.

## Internet Browsing

Internet Browsing allows your chatbot to search the web for answers. 

This feature helps in providing up-to-date information by accessing the internet directly.

When enabled, the chatbot can perform searches using a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE). The chatbot sends search queries to the CSE, retrieves results, and uses them to generate responses.

For example, you can ask for the current bitcoin price:

<img src={InternetDemo} width="700"/>

Demo here: https://aipower.org/openai-gpt-4o-mini-chat-bot-demo/

To configure the settings for Internet Browsing, go to the <b>Dashboard - Chatbot - Settings</b> tab and click on the gear icon next to the Internet Browsing label, as shown below, to open the settings window. 
   
<img src={InternetSettings} width="700"/>

<img src={InternetSettingsWindow} width="700"/>

- Enter your <b>Google API Key</b> in the provided field.
- Enter your <b>Google Custom Search Engine ID</b> in the provided field.
- Optionally, configure the <b>Region</b>, <b>Language</b>, and <b>Number of Results</b>.

Here’s how to create your Google API key and Custom Search Engine ID:

### Creating Google API Key

If you are already using Google Voices and have an API key, you can use the same key for Internet Browsing. You just need to enable "Custom Search API" in Google Cloud Console.

If you do not have an API key, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Create a new project or select an existing project.

<img src={GoogleCloud} width="700" alt="Google Cloud Console" />

4. Give your project a name and then hit **Create**.

<img src={GoogleCloudProject1} width="700" alt="Create Project" />

5. After it has been created, make sure that you select it.

<img src={GoogleCloudProject2} width="700" alt="Select Project" />

6. Click on **Dashboard**.

<img src={Dashboard} width="700" alt="Dashboard" />

7. Click on **Go to APIs Overview**.

<img src={APIOverview} width="500" alt="APIs Overview" />

8. Click on **Enable APIs and Services**.

<img src={APIEnable} width="700" alt="Enable APIs and Services" />

9. Search for **Custom Search API** and select it.

<img src={APISearch} width="700" alt="Search API" />

10. Click on **Enable** to enable this API.

<img src={APIEnable2} width="700" alt="Enable API" />

11. You need to activate your **Google Cloud Billing Account** to use this feature. You can learn how to create a billing account [here](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/create-billing-account).

<img src={Billing} width="700" alt="Billing Account" />
<img src={Billing2} width="700" alt="Billing Account Setup" />

12. After setting up your billing account and enabling the API, you’re now ready to create an API key. Navigate to the **Credentials** page, click on **Create Credentials**, and then choose **API Key**.

<img src={Credentials} width="700" alt="Create Credentials" />

13. After your API key has been generated, click on the **Copy** button to copy it.

<img src={Credentials2} width="700" alt="Copy API Key" />

Once you have your API key, open the plugin’s **Dashboard - Chatbot** page. Go to the **Settings** tab and enter your API key in the provided field.

<img src={GoogleAPIKey} width="700" alt="Google API Key" />

By following these steps, you will create a Google API key that can be used to enable Internet Browsing for your chatbot.

### Creating Custom Search Engine

To enable your chatbot to use the internet browsing feature, you need to create a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) and obtain its ID. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/) page.
2. Click on **Get started** if you don't have a search engine yet, or **Add** if you want to create a new one.

<img src={cse1}/>

3. Enter the necessary details:
    - **Name of the search engine**: Give your search engine a name.
    - **What to search?**: You can specify certain sites or entire web to search. Select "Search the entire web" if you want to search entire web.

<img src={cse2} />

4. Click on **Create**.
5. Once created, click on **Control Panel** to access the settings of your new search engine.
6. Under the **Basics** tab, you will find your **Search Engine ID**. Copy this ID.

<img src={cse3} width="700" />

7. Enter this Search Engine ID in the **Internet Browsing** section of the plugin’s settings.

<img src={GoogleCSE} width="700" />

By following these steps, you will have created a custom search engine and obtained the necessary ID to enable internet browsing for your chatbot.

### Limitations

- **Beta Feature**: The internet browsing feature is still in beta. We are continually learning and improving its functionality.
- **Query Optimization**: Currently, the plugin sends user queries directly to Google without optimization. For example, if a user asks, "What is the bitcoin price now?" the exact query is sent to Google. However, if the user follows up with "What about Ethereum?" the plugin sends this follow-up query directly, which may not yield relevant results. We plan to improve this by adding query optimization using AI models to provide more relevant content.
- **Pricing**: Google Custom Search API offers 100 free queries per day. Beyond this limit, Google charges $5 per 1000 additional queries, up to 10k queries per day. If you need more queries, you will need to sign up for billing in the Google API Console. Google charges $5 per 1000 additional queries, up to 10k queries per day.

## Feedback Collection

This feature allows you to gather user feedback when they interact with the chatbot.

<img src={samplefeedback} />

You can enable feedback collection option in the **Dashboard - Chatbot** under **General Settings**. 

Turn on the **Feedback** switch.

<img src={EnableFeedback} width="400" />

Next to the switch, there is a gear icon. Clicking it opens the feedback collection settings window, where you can configure the following options:

<img src={FeedbackSettings} width="700" />

Here, you can customize or translate the feedback text:

1. **Feedback Title**: Default is "Feedback."
2. **Feedback Message**: Default is "Please provide details: (optional)."
3. **Feedback Success Message**: Default is "Thank you for your feedback!"

:::info

When feedback collection is enabled, logging is automatically activated. This means the system will save logs of conversations to store the feedback provided by users.

:::

When feedback collection is enabled, thumbs up and thumbs down icons appear under each AI response. Users can click them to give feedback. The feedback window matches the chat window's style for a consistent look.

<img src={fbbuttons} />

You can view user feedback from the **Dashboard - Chatbot** page under the **Logs** tab.

<img src={viewfb} />

## Image Upload

This feature allows users to upload images directly into the chat for analysis by supported models like **GPT-4o** and **GPT-4o Vision**.

You can view demo here: https://aipower.org/gpt-4o-chat-bot-demo-image-interpreter/

You can enable or disable this feature from the **Dashboard - Chatbot** under **General Settings**. Simply toggle the **Image Upload** switch.

<img src={EnableImageUpload} width="400" />

When enabled, an image upload icon will appear next to the send button, allowing users to upload images for analysis.

<img src={demo} />

:::info

Image Upload and streaming cannot work concurrently. This function only works in non-streaming mode.

:::

To configure how images are processed and stored, go to the **Dashboard - Chatbot** tab and click the gear icon next to **Images** in the **Settings** tab. 

You can choose;

- where to store images (WordPress upload folder or media library),
- set the image processing method (URL or Base64),
- adjust image quality (Auto, Low, or High),
- and enable automatic deletion of images after processing. For automatic deletion, the image processing method must be set to Base64.
