Welcome to the guide for the AI Power WordPress plugin's ChatGPT feature!

You can set up ChatGPT in [less than a minute](quick-setup) by copying the shortcode and pasting it on your website!

Deploy the bot on your website as a widget on all pages or as a shortcode, giving you flexibility in placement.

With one click, the ChatGPT bot can understand your website's content, offering more relevant responses.

The plugin also integrates with Whisper for speech-to-text and Google and Eleven Labs' text-to-speech services.
