# Voice Chat

With our chatbot, we understand the importance of creating a more interactive and engaging experience for your users.

Therefore, we've integrated with top-notch voice technologies to elevate your chatbot interaction.

- **Voice Input**: For voice input, we've integrated with **Whisper**, which is a **Speech-to-Text** model from OpenAI. With this feature, your users can speak directly to the chatbot using their microphone, and the chatbot will transcribe and process their spoken words as if they were typed messages.
- **Voice Output**: You can enable voice output for your chatbot with our integrations with **ElevenLabs** and **Google Text to Speech**. This allows your chatbot to read out its responses, creating a more dynamic and conversational experience for your users.

By combining these features, you can create a seamless voice chat experience for your users, making your chatbot more accessible and intuitive to use.

## Voice Input

You can enable or disable the voice input.

If you enable this option, the chatbot will display a microphone icon.

When the user clicks on the microphone icon, the chatbot will start listening to the user.

The user can speak to the chatbot and the chatbot will convert the speech to text. You can customize mic and stop button color.

### Whisper Integration

Whisper is an advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI.

You can view demo here: https://aipower.org/gpt-4o-chat-bot-demo-speech-to-text/

It's designed to convert spoken language into written text, and it's trained on a large amount of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.

Integrating Whisper with our chatbot can elevate the user experience, providing a hands-free mode of interaction that is particularly useful for users who are visually impaired, have motor disabilities, or simply prefer voice interaction.

Here's how you can enable and customize the Whisper integration:

#### Voice and Model Synchronization

ElevenLabs offers a powerful and dynamic suite of voices and models for your chat system.

To ensure you're leveraging these features to their fullest potential, it's crucial to keep them synchronized with your plugin settings.

This guide will walk you through syncing voices and models after inputting your ElevenLabs API key.

#### Syncing Voices

1. **Saving the API Key:** After acquiring your ElevenLabs API key, enter it into the designated field within your plugin settings.
2. **Click on "Sync Voices":** With your API key saved, you'll find a button labeled "Sync Voices". Initiating this will commence the synchronization process, importing all the voices tied to your ElevenLabs account.

<img src={SyncVoices} width="400" />

3. **Completion:** Post synchronization, all the voices available to you will be seamlessly integrated into your chat system. You can then cherry-pick your desired voice from the dropdown menu.

#### Voice Settings

Upon successfully synchronizing the voices from ElevenLabs, the plugin automatically pulls in the following voice settings:

1. **Stability:** Determines the consistency of the voice output. A higher stability setting ensures the voice remains steady and consistent, avoiding unexpected fluctuations or changes in tone.

2. **Similarity Boost:** This setting emphasizes the resemblance of the generated voice to a particular target voice. Elevating the similarity boost will make the synthesized voice sound more like the target.

3. **Speaker Boost:** This enhances the distinctive characteristics of a chosen speaker's voice. By increasing the speaker boost, the synthesized voice will embody more of the unique nuances and idiosyncrasies of the target speaker.

4. **Style:** Reflects the tone and manner of the generated voice. Whether you want a voice that's cheerful, serious, or neutral, adjusting the style allows you to fine-tune the emotion and demeanor of the voice output.

#### Syncing Models

1. **Saving the API Key:** If not done already, ensure your ElevenLabs API key is stored.
2. **Click on "Sync Models":** Adjacent to the "Sync Voices" button, you'll spot another labeled "Sync Models". Activating this will fetch all models associated with your ElevenLabs account.

<img src={SyncModels} width="400" />

3. **Completion:** Post synchronization, you're set to deploy these models within your chat infrastructure.

#### Understanding Models

At present, two primary models are at your disposal:

- **Eleven English v1:** Standard English language model to generate speech in a variety of voices, styles and moods.
- **Eleven Multilingual v1:** Generate lifelike speech in multiple languages and create content that resonates with a broader audience. Languages: English (USA), English (UK), English (Australia), English (Canada), German, Polish
 Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), Italian, French (France), French (Canada), Portuguese (Portgual), Portuguese (Brazil) and Hindi.

#### Limitations

While the new ElevenLabs voice integration with ChatGPT brings exciting possibilities for chatbot creators, it’s important to be aware of its limitations.

Understanding these restrictions will help you make informed decisions when using this feature.

- **Multilingual v1 Limitations**: Some numbers and symbols may currently be pronounced incorrectly. The generated speech can be unstable if the text exceeds 1000 characters.
- **API Errors**: If you choose to hide API errors in chat, users won’t see errors like “out of quota” or “invalid API key.” Instead, they will only see the chat text from OpenAI without any audio from ElevenLabs. This could lead to confusion if users expect to hear a voice response.
- **Quota Restrictions**: Depending on the ElevenLabs plan you choose, you may face limitations in terms of characters per month, custom voices, and commercial licensing. The free plan, for example, offers 10,000 characters per month and up to 3 custom voices without a commercial license.

By being aware of these limitations, you can make the most of the ElevenLabs voice integration with ChatGPT and create unique, engaging experiences for your chatbot users.
