# Voice Chat

We offer voice integration for your chatbot to create a more interactive experience.

- **Speech to Text**: For voice input, we've integrated with **Whisper**, which is a **Speech-to-Text** model from OpenAI. With this feature, your users can speak directly to the chatbot using their microphone, and the chatbot will transcribe and process their spoken words as if they were typed messages.
- **Text to Speech**: You can enable voice output for your chatbot with our integrations with **OpenAI**, **ElevenLabs** and **Google Text to Speech**. This allows your chatbot to read out its responses, creating a more dynamic and conversational experience for your users.

These features make your chatbot more accessible and easy to use.

## Speech to Text

You can enable or disable the voice input feature for the chatbot. 

If enabled, a microphone icon will appear, and when clicked, the chatbot will start listening to the user. The user's speech will be converted to text using Whisper, an advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. You can also customize the microphone and stop button colors.

Whisper is designed to convert spoken language into written text and is trained on multilingual data. 

This feature can improve the user experience, particularly for users who prefer voice interaction or need hands-free access.

You can view a live demo [here](https://aipower.org/gpt-4o-chat-bot-demo-text-to-speech/).

Here's how you can enable and customize the Whisper integration:

## Text to Speech

Our plugin supports three different Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers: OpenAI, Google, and ElevenLabs.

### OpenAI

OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, allowing you to convert written text into lifelike spoken audio to improve the interactive experience of your ChatGPT bot.

TTS is an AI model that converts text to natural-sounding spoken text. 

We offer two model variants via OpenAI integration:

- tts-1: Optimized for real-time text-to-speech use cases.
- tts-1-hd: Optimized for higher quality.

#### Key Features and Capabilities:

- **Multiple Voices**: Choose from six built-in voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, and shimmer, to find the perfect tone for your audience.
- **High-Quality Audio Options**: Select between the standard `tts-1` model for lower latency or the `tts-1-hd` model for higher quality audio.
- **Supported Output Formats**: The default audio format is MP3, but you can also choose from OPUS, AAC, or FLAC, depending on your needs.
  - *Opus*: Ideal for internet streaming and communication, offering low latency.
  - *AAC*: Perfect for digital audio compression, widely used in platforms like YouTube, Android, and iOS.
  - *FLAC*: Best for lossless audio compression, preferred by audiophiles for archiving.
- **Voice Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the generated audio to suit your needs. Select a value from 0.25 to 4.0, with 1.0 being the default speed. This allows for greater flexibility in matching the pace of speech to your specific requirements.
- **Language Support**: While the TTS voices are optimized for English, the model supports a wide range of languages, following the Whisper model's language capabilities.

#### Usage:

To enable this feature, follow these steps:

1. Access your chat bot settings and locate the "Speech" tab.
2. Tick the "Enable Text to Speech" option.

<img src={OpenAITS} />

3. Choose "OpenAI" as your provider from the dropdown menu.
4. Select your preferred model, voice, output format, and voice speed.
5. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

There are two additional options on this Speech tab:

- Allow users to switch voice on/off: If you tick this option, an audio button will appear in the top bar of the chatbot. Users can enable or disable the audio from here.
- Muted by default: If you tick this option, the audio will be muted on the frontend by default. The user must click the audio button to enable it.

Go ahead and chat with your bot to experience its new voice capabilities.

#### Voice Settings

Upon successfully synchronizing the voices from ElevenLabs, the plugin automatically pulls in the following voice settings:

1. **Stability:** Determines the consistency of the voice output. A higher stability setting ensures the voice remains steady and consistent, avoiding unexpected fluctuations or changes in tone.

2. **Similarity Boost:** This setting emphasizes the resemblance of the generated voice to a particular target voice. Elevating the similarity boost will make the synthesized voice sound more like the target.

3. **Speaker Boost:** This enhances the distinctive characteristics of a chosen speaker's voice. By increasing the speaker boost, the synthesized voice will embody more of the unique nuances and idiosyncrasies of the target speaker.

4. **Style:** Reflects the tone and manner of the generated voice. Whether you want a voice that's cheerful, serious, or neutral, adjusting the style allows you to fine-tune the emotion and demeanor of the voice output.


#### Understanding Models

- **Multilingual v2**: This model has good stability, great language diversity, and fantastic accuracy in cloning voices and accents. Its speed is rather remarkable considering its size as it supports 28 languages, but it is slower than English v1.
- **Turbo v2.5**: It generates human-like text to speech in 32 languages with low latency.
- **Turbo v2**: A highly optimized model, specifically tailored for low-latency applications without sacrificing vocal performance and keeping inline with the quality standard that people have come to expect from our models. It is an English-only model.
- **English v1:** Standard English language model to generate speech in a variety of voices, styles and moods.
- **Multilingual v1:** Generate lifelike speech in multiple languages and create content that resonates with a broader audience. Languages: English (USA), English (UK), English (Australia), English (Canada), German, Polish
 Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), Italian, French (France), French (Canada), Portuguese (Portgual), Portuguese (Brazil) and Hindi.

#### Limitations

While the new ElevenLabs voice integration with ChatGPT brings exciting possibilities for chatbot creators, it’s important to be aware of its limitations.

Understanding these restrictions will help you make informed decisions when using this feature.

- **Multilingual v1 Limitations**: Some numbers and symbols may currently be pronounced incorrectly. The generated speech can be unstable if the text exceeds 1000 characters.
- **API Errors**: If you choose to hide API errors in chat, users won’t see errors like “out of quota” or “invalid API key.” Instead, they will only see the chat text from OpenAI without any audio from ElevenLabs. This could lead to confusion if users expect to hear a voice response.
- **Quota Restrictions**: Depending on the ElevenLabs plan you choose, you may face limitations in terms of characters per month, custom voices, and commercial licensing. The free plan, for example, offers 10,000 characters per month and up to 3 custom voices without a commercial license.

By being aware of these limitations, you can make the most of the ElevenLabs voice integration with ChatGPT and create unique, engaging experiences for your chatbot users.

## Hide API Errors in Chat

You can enable or disable this option under the ChatGPT settings tab.

<img src={hideerrors} width="300" />

If enabled, API errors from ElevenLabs, Google, or OpenAI will not be shown in the chat box to the user. We recommend disabling this only when troubleshooting.
