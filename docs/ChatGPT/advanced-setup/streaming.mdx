# Streaming

The Streaming feature is an advanced functionality that enhances the responsiveness and interactivity of the chatbot. 

Streaming allows the chatbot to display responses in real-time as each chunk of data arrives from the API, rather than waiting for the entire response to complete. 

This method speeds up the interaction, providing a smoother and more engaging user experience.

## Enabling Streaming

Here are the steps to enable streaming for your chatbot:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="shortcode" label="Shortcode" default>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to the <b>ChatGPT - Shortcode</b> tab in your dashboard.</li>
        <li>Click on the <b>Settings</b> tab.</li>
        <img src={Streaming} width="300"/>
        <li>Locate and enable the "Streaming" option.</li>
        <li>After adjusting the settings, click on the <b>Save</b> button to apply the changes.</li>
    </ul>
    </TabItem>
<TabItem value="widget" label="Widget">
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to the <b>ChatGPT - Widget</b> tab in your dashboard.</li>
        <li>Click on the <b>Settings</b> tab.</li>
        <img src={Streaming} width="300"/>
        <li>Locate and enable the "Streaming" option.</li>
        <li>After adjusting the settings, click on the <b>Save</b> button to apply the changes.</li>
    </ul>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How It Works
With the Streaming feature enabled, the chatbot utilizes the Server-sent events (SSE) standard.

This approach facilitates an open connection between the server and the client, allowing for the continuous flow of data in real-time.

As a result, the chatbot displays each part of the response as soon as it's received, making the conversation flow faster and more naturally.

## Limitations
While the Streaming feature offers a quicker response time, it has some limitations:

Audio-related functionalities such as voice chat (text-to-speech and speech-to-text) are not supported in this mode.

These features require complete response data to function correctly, which is incompatible with the streaming method.
