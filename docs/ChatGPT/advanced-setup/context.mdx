# Context

One of the most important aspects in the custom ChatGPT is the context.

Providing a relevant context to your chatbot is key for it to make sense of the conversation, remember past interactions and offer personalized responses.

Let's explore the various aspects of context and how you can customize them for your chatbot.

## Custom Instructions

You can give custom instructions to the chatbot which can be used alongside the Excerpt or Embeddings options.

:::tip

Check out our [Chatbot Prompt Library](docs/prompt-guide/chatbot-prompts.mdx)

:::

Remember, adjusting these settings will directly influence the chatbot's understanding of the user's intent and its ability to generate relevant responses.

It's recommended to experiment with different configurations to find what works best for your use case.

The Custom Instructions feature allows you to supplement the chatbot's understanding of the conversation with predefined or customized context.

This could be anything from the specific role the bot is playing, the nature of the website it's on, or the type of queries it's expected to handle.

For instance, if your website primarily deals with sales, the chatbot can be given additional context related to sales support.

This way, the chatbot not only knows it's interacting with a user but also understands that it's part of a sales support team on a specific website.

This contextual awareness allows it to tailor its responses more precisely to the user's needs.

The importance of the Custom Instructions feature lies in its ability to significantly boost the chatbot's performance.

By providing relevant instructions, you can guide the AI to deliver highly personalized and situation-appropriate responses.

Whether you're using ready-to-use templates or crafting your own unique contexts, this feature gives you the power to shape the chatbot's interactions as per your requirements.

For example, we're using the same chatbot on our website and have named our assistant 'Lisa'. We've instructed her not to respond to any questions unless they pertain to our plugin.

Here's our custom instructions for Lisa:

*"You are a helpful AI assistant. Your name is Lisa. Your primary purpose is to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information exclusively about the AI Power WordPress plugin. If a user asks a question or initiates a discussion that is not directly related to the plugin or its features, functionalities, and usage, do not provide an answer or engage in the conversation. Instead, politely redirect the users focus back to the AI Power plugin and its related content. Your expertise should be limited to the websites content, and you must not provide any information or suggestions on topics that fall outside the scope of the AI Power plugin."*

You can craft your own instructions based on your specific needs.

### Configuring Custom Instructions

## Conversation Memory

Conversation Memory helps make interactions with the chatbot more engaging and meaningful by recalling the context of previous conversations. This allows the chatbot to provide more personalized and relevant responses.

When you enable the Remember Conversation option, the chatbot can remember the dialogue history. This means the chatbot can pick up the conversation where it left off, even after an interruption or if the user returns later.

Conversation history is stored in the browser's local storage. 

When a user interacts with the chatbot, their conversation is saved locally. Each time a new question is asked, the plugin retrieves previous conversations from local storage and sends them in the prompt to the OpenAI API. This helps the chatbot understand the context and respond coherently.

### Memory Limit

Limit feature lets you set the number of messages the chatbot will remember from the conversation history. 

The default is 100, but it can be adjusted between 3 and 500 based on your needs.

For example, if set to 10, up to 10 messages will be saved. Once the limit is reached, the oldest conversation will be deleted to keep the total at 10.

### Excerpt

The excerpt is an optional piece of text associated with a WordPress post, typically serving as a concise **summary of the content**.

If no excerpt is specified, WordPress automatically generates one using the first 55 words of the post.

Our AI chatbot utilizes this feature in an innovative way to provide more context-aware responses.

Enabling this option will allow the chatbot to generate responses based on the excerpt of your pages.

Here's how it works:

- **Retrieving Excerpts**: When a user interacts with the chatbot, it first retrieves the excerpt of the page it resides on. This excerpt serves as a brief summary of the page's content.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The retrieved excerpt is then fed into the chatbot as context. This allows the chatbot to understand the subject matter of the current page, thereby promoting more relevant and accurate responses.
- **Interactive Conversation**: The chatbot uses the context to generate responses and interact with the user. It is designed to maintain a conversation that aligns with the topic of the page, providing a unique, context-aware user experience.

This feature essentially equips our chatbot with a better understanding of the page content, improving its ability to engage users with more relevant and informed responses.

:::tip

If you're planning to use Excerpt feature only (without Embeddings), it's crucial to ensure that your post excerpts are well-crafted and informative. 

Consider revisiting and improving your current post excerpts. The better your excerpts, the better your chatbot's performance will be.

:::

### Embeddings

This feature requires integration with Pinecone or Qdrant.

Learn more about [Embeddings](docs/embeddings.mdx).

If enabled, the chatbot will generate responses based on the content of your pages using embeddings, which are vector space representations of text.

Our plugin uses vector database as an **external long-term memory** for the bot. 

We offer two different options to select: **Pinecone** or **Qdrant**.

For Embeddings, we offer two different methods:

- **Embeddings + Completions**: This method uses the Embeddings to find the most relevant page and then uses completions to generate a response. This is the **recommended** option for chat bots and widgets.
- **Embeddings Only**: This method uses the Embeddings to find the most relevant page and then uses the content of the page to generate a response. It does not use any ai model for generating a response. 

#### Vector DB Selection

Upon enabling the Embeddings feature, a dropdown menu labeled **Vector DB** becomes active.

<img src={DBProvider} width="300" />

This feature allows you to choose different vector dbs for different bots.

#### Index / Collection Selection

Indexes represent the embeddings of your website's content, stored in the Pinecone vector database. In Qdrant, these are referred to as Collections.

After setting up your Pinecone or Qdrant integration, you can sync your indexes/collections. All available indexes/collections will be listed in the Index/Collection dropdown menu.

<img src={indices} width="300" />

Using different indexes for various chatbots is highly advantageous, especially when managing multiple chatbots across different pages or websites with unique content or objectives.

You can manage and sync your indexes/collections through the AI Training - Settings tab.

<img src={IndexSync} width="700" />

#### Limit

The **Limit** option allows you to select how many of the nearest or most relevant answers to retrieve from the vector database. It's a dropdown with a default value of 1, and the maximum is 5. 

For example, if 1 is selected, the chatbot will retrieve 1 nearest answer from the vector database and feed it to the bot. If 5 is selected, it will retrieve the 5 nearest answers and feed them to the bot, providing a broader context for generating responses.

#### Confidence Score Threshold

The **Confidence Score Threshold** option lets you set a minimum confidence level for the retrieved answers. 

You can choose a threshold between 1 and 100, with the default set at 20.

<img src={confidence2} width="300" />

If the confidence score of an answer is below 20, it will not be used by the chatbot. 

You can experiment with this setting to find the threshold that works best for your needs.

:::tip

Based on our tests, the `text-embedding-ada-002` model provides the best results when using embeddings.

:::

Additionally, you can use the Revise Answer feature in the logs to revise any poor results and fine-tune the responses.

**How Confidence Score Works**

Whenever a user asks a question to the bot, our plugin sends that query to the embedding API to generate a vector representation. This vector is then sent to Pinecone or Qdrant to retrieve the nearest results from the vector database.

The number of results retrieved depends on the **Limit** setting:
- If the limit is set to 1, the plugin will retrieve only the single nearest result.
- If the limit is set to 5, it will retrieve the top 5 nearest results.

Each retrieved result has a score ranging from 0 to 1. This score indicates how closely the result matches the query. The **Confidence Score Threshold** determines which results will be fed to the bot:
- If the threshold is set to 50%, only results with a score above 0.5 will be used as context for the bot.
- Any results with a score below 0.5 will not be fed to the bot.

#### Example for Better Understanding

Let's walk through an example. 

Suppose we're using Qdrant as our vector database with a 1536 cosine index and the embedding model is `text-embedding-ada-002`. 

The **Limit** is set to 5, meaning the plugin will retrieve 5 results from the vector database. 

We've added the following records to the vector database:

1. Senol Sahin loves coding.
2. Senol Sahin has 1 kid.
3. Senol Sahin is the lead developer of the AI Power plugin.
4. Senol Sahin is from Istanbul, Turkey.
5. Senol Sahin is 32 years old.

The **Confidence Score Threshold** is set to 70. This means that only results with a score above 0.7 will be used as context.

Now, let's ask the bot: **"Where is Senol Sahin from?"**

<img src={con1} />

The bot correctly answers that he is from Istanbul. 

When we check the logs, we see that the confidence score for the retrieved data is strong, with a score of 88.

<img src={con2} />

Since our threshold is 70, all 5 results are sent to the bot, as they all have scores above 0.7:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": "senol sahin is from istanbul, turkey.\nsenol sahin is 32 years old.\nsenol sahin has 1 kid.\nsenol sahin loves coding.\nsenol sahin is the lead developer of ai power plugin.",
  "tokens": 7,
  "matches": [
    {
      "id": 4224,
      "score": "0.8824"
    },
    {
      "id": 4223,
      "score": "0.8219"
    },
    {
      "id": 4227,
      "score": "0.8169"
    },
    {
      "id": 4228,
      "score": "0.7835"
    },
    {
      "id": 4225,
      "score": "0.7696"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, let's increase our threshold to 85 and ask the same question again.

<img src={con4} />

The bot still gives the correct answer, but this time, the confidence score is higher: Confidence Score: 92% Highly Confident! 

<img src={con5} />

Checking the context, we see that only 3 results were fed to the bot because the other 2 were below the 85% threshold.

<img src={con3} />

Next, let's ask the bot something not related to the data in our vector database, like simply saying "hi." 

With the confidence threshold still set to 85, the bot greets us normally.

<img src={con7} />

When we check the logs, we notice there's no confidence score, and no context was fed to the bot from the vector database.

<img src={con8} />

Why? 

Because all the results for the query "hi" were below the 85% score, so the bot wasn't fed any irrelevant data.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": "",
  "tokens": 1,
  "matches": [
    
  ]
}
```

Finally, let's set the confidence threshold to the lowest value, 1, and say "hi" to the bot again.

<img src={con10} />

This time, when we check the logs, we see that the bot was fed all 5 records from the database because they all had scores higher than 1 for the query "hi." 

However, the results were irrelevant, highlighting the importance of setting an appropriate confidence threshold.

**Conclusion**

The **Confidence Score Threshold** and **Limit** settings are powerful tools that allow you to fine-tune how your chatbot retrieves and uses data from the vector database. By adjusting these settings, you can control the relevance and accuracy of the bot's responses.

**Benefits:**
- **Improved Relevance:** By setting a higher confidence threshold, you ensure that only the most relevant data is used in the bot's responses.
- **Contextual Understanding:** The ability to retrieve multiple relevant answers (using the Limit setting) improves the bot's ability to understand and respond to complex queries.
- **Customization:** These settings allow you to tailor the bot's behavior to your specific needs, balancing between precision and context.

**Things to Be Careful Of:**
- **Setting the Threshold Too Low:** If the threshold is set too low, the bot might be fed irrelevant data, leading to poor responses.
- **Setting the Threshold Too High:** If the Limit is set too high, the bot might receive too much information, potentially diluting the relevance of its responses.

Experiment with these settings to find the optimal balance for your use case, and use the Revise Answer feature in the logs to refine the bot's performance.

## Response Quality

The **Response Quality** feature allows you to improve your chatbot's performance by revising answers and assessing confidence levels.

### Revise Answer

The "Revise Answer" feature lets you update chatbot responses that didn't meet your expectations. 

To use this feature, ensure that the **"Save Logs"** option is enabled under the **Security** tab in the bot settings. This allows chat logs to be stored for review.

#### Steps to Revise a Response

1. **Access Chat Logs:**
   - Go to the **ChatGPT - Logs** tab.
   - Browse or search for the conversation you want to revise and click "View."

<img src={revise1} />

2. **Revise the Answer:**
   - Click on the "Revise Answer" link next to the AI-generated response.
   - A text area will appear where you can input the improved response.

<img src={revise2} />

3. **Save the Revision:**
   - After entering the revised answer, click "Save." The chatbot will use this updated response for similar queries in the future.

<img src={revise3} />

### Confidence Score

The **Confidence Score** feature provides insights into how closely the chatbot's response matches the user's query. 

This score is calculated based on the relevancy of responses fetched from vector databases like Pinecone or Qdrant.

<img src={confidence} />

The score is displayed as a percentage, reflecting the confidence level of the chatbot's response:

- **Absolutely Certain! 💯** (98% and above)
- **Highly Confident! 👍** (90% to 97%)
- **Strong Match! ✔️** (80% to 89%)
- **Good Match 😊** (70% to 79%)
- **Needs Improvement ⚠️** (50% to 69%)
- **Uncertain 🤔** (30% to 49%)
- **Poor Match 🚩** (10% to 29%)
- **Highly Unreliable ❌** (Below 10%)

### Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy:** Quickly identify and correct low-confidence responses.
- **Enhanced User Trust:** Users can see that responses are backed by a confidence score.
- **Continuous Learning:** The chatbot evolves by learning from revised responses.

By effectively using the **Revise Answer** and **Confidence Score** features, you can ensure your chatbot consistently delivers accurate and reliable answers, enhancing the overall user experience.

## User Aware

Enabling this option makes the chatbot aware of the user's **Display Name** on their WordPress profile page.

If the display name is empty, the chatbot will use the user's **username** to personalize the interaction.

<img src={UserAwareSample} width="700" />

This feature only works if the user is logged in.

:::tip

"User Awareness" is only functional when the user is logged in.

If the majority of your chatbot users are non-registered or anonymous visitors, turning on this feature might not bring much benefit.

:::tip
Conversation starters are not shown again if a user revisits the page. The chatbot displays the starters only for first-time users.
If you want to display the conversation starters all the time, then you need to disable auto-loading past conversations.
You can disable it under the **ChatGPT - Settings** tab.

**Styling Options**

- Conversation starters inherit their background color from the User Message Color setting, meaning they will match the background color of user messages in your chat.
- Font color and font size for conversation starters is taken from the main chat window's font properties.

That's all! By following these steps, you can enhance user interaction on your site by providing them with immediate questions to engage with your ChatGPT bot.
