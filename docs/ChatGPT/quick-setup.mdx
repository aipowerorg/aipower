# 1-Minute Setup

You can deploy our chatbot on your WordPress website in less than a minute using either shortcodes or widgets.

## Shortcodes

Shortcodes are placed in the page body, while widgets can be placed at the bottom of the website on the left or right side.

### How to Use Shortcodes

The shortcode method lets you add a chatbot to individual pages quickly:

1. Go to the page where you want to add the chatbot.
2. Paste the shortcode `[wpaicg_chatgpt]` into the page content.
3. Save the page.

<img src={ShortCode2} width="700" />

That's it! Visit the page to ensure the chatbot is working.

## Widgets

The widget method adds a chatbot to all pages on your website:

1. Navigate to **ChatGPT â†’ Widget** tab.
2. Enable the widget. This applies the bot to the whole site.
3. Save the settings.

<img src={Widget} width="700" />

That's it! Visit the site to ensure the chatbot is functioning correctly.
